                  <h2>Making of the Box:</h2>
                  <p>I wanted to make a box that was easy to assemble and also easily taken apart. That means NO GLUE. First, I thought 
                    about including screws and bolts, but then I saw a box made by a fellow student that used joints that looked like 
                    Mortise and Tenon joints and decided to give that a go. Eventually I ended up designing a box that needs <b>zero tools</b> 
                    for assembly. I opted for Mortise and Tenon joints, because when I used finger joints for my box from week 2, I had to 
                    use glue to keep my box together. Also that box felt weak when it was loaded with heavy materials.
                    <br>
                    To connect the bottom with the other sides of the box I had all the <i>tenons</i> attached to the bottom plate and 
                    alls the <i>mortises/holes</i> in the other plates. I made this design choide to prevent the bottom from falling when the 
                    box is lifted up. 
                    <br>
                    I also needed a piece in the middle that would separate the box into 2 parts. <b>Part I</b> for the plant + 
                    water bottle and 1<b>Part II</b> for the electronics/microcontroller. <b>Part II</b> also has a plateau for the 
                    peristaltic.
                    <br>
                    Before I started designing the box in 360, I measured the water bottle, plant cup and peristaltic pump with a caliper. 
                    I also made a rough sketch of how I wanted to connect the different plates/sides of the box.
                    <br>
                    <h4>Brainstorm:</h4>
                    <img src="./brainstorm_measure.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <img src="./brainstorm_joints.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <br>
                    After that brainstorm, I turned to Fusion 360 to start designing the box in 3D. Instead of making drawins in 2D, 
                    I designed the entire box in 3D and used the projection function to get sketches of the different sides of the box. I 
                    saved these sketches as DXF files and cut them with the lasercutter.
                    <br>
                    I wanted my design in Fusion 360 to be quite flexible because I wasn't sure how big my final box was eventually going to be. 
                    I anticipated I may run into issues in my design process and assembly, so I wanted it to be easy to change the dimensions of my box. 
                    For this, I used parameters for the width, length, height, corner_space, finger joint lenght, material thickness, etc.
                    <br>
                    In my design it is fairly easy to adjust the number of joints on each sides of the plagues. However, this was not very easy to accomplish. 
                    When I started my first attempt I drew the side with the fingerjoints and extruded that in one go. However, I soon realized this was't going to work 
                    if I wanted to adjust the number of joints. I then switched to extruding a rectangle, then extruding 1 single joint on a side and extending that feature. 
                    I remembered this trick from following tutorials that helped me make the finger joint box in week 2. This method proved to be much more effective.
                    <br>
                    <h4>FUSION 360: TODO</h4>
                    <br>
                    When my design was finished I wanted to test if my Mortise and Tenon joints would work. Therefore, I copy pasted my design and 
                    halved the dimensions. I had to do some problem solving because of the middle piece and some joints because it didn't perfectly 
                    translate to a much smaller size. However, after a quick fix I had enough to test my joints and design. I printed 3 sides of this mini test box:
                    bottom, middle and side plates.
                    <img src="./mini_test.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <br>
                    Fortunately, this test showed my joints worked. I then decided to cut out my entire box using cartboard. I felt like I needed to see the physical 
                    box before I continued designing the holder for the peristaltic pump and the holes for the wiring. By using cartboard I would be able to easily cut 
                    out a hole for wiring and adjust my design. When I was satisfied I measured the dimensions with a caliper and included it in my 3D design. 
                    Thankfully, the box was easy to assembl and the joints fit really well first try (bless). I didn't have to use any glue and I could feel the box was very sturdy.
