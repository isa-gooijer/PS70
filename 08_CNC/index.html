          <h2>MAKING CHOCOLATE BARS IN THE SHAPE OF MASSACHUSSETS!</h2>
          <p>I was inspired by Kasia's marble states using <i>CNC</i> and <i>vacuumforming</i> and previous students that 
            made chocolate moulds. Designing the chocolate bar in Fusion 360 was fairly easy. I used a picture from the 
            internet, imported it into Inkscape and used the trace bitmap function to get the outline. I imported this into
            Fusion 360. However, this gave met 2 outlines that also didn't fit perfectly. I removed one of the outlines and 
            did some cleaning up to make sure the outline didn't have any gaps and would work well. I used the offset function 
            to get a 2nd outline on the inside of the original outline. Then I used the text function to create the 'MA' letters.
            <br>
            <iframe src="https://college269.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SHd38bfQT1fb47330c99967431a5cc9fca59?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <br>
            I exported the sketch as a DXF file and then Kasia helped me to figure out the correct settings on the CNC machine.
            <br>
            Thickness: 17.7-17.9mm.<br>
            Cutout: ~8mm<br>
            After the first cutout, I thought it was a bit small. I also wanted to maximize the use of the large plastic in 
            the vacuum former. Therefore, I made a bigger Massachussets cutout as well. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Kasia also helped me with the vacuumforming, which went very well. It didn't transfer all the detail as perfectly, 
            but that was expected. Especially, around the numbers the plastic didn't go down as much and reach the lower plateau.
            However, it was still good enough to be able to read 'MA'. <br>
            I took the mould back to my room, 'stole' some chocolate chip from the dining hall (#sorrynotsorry), and melted it in a microwave.
            Because the chocolate chips likely weren't good quality, they didn't melt that well (the chocolate remained kind 
            of thick/viscuous). However, it was good enough for a simple mould like this. <br>
            I also had some left over white chocolate chips, so I decide to try 2 different "colours".<br>
            Once the chocolate had cured, I removed some ridges with a knife for a smoother finish, but overall they came 
            out pretty nicely. <br>
            I'm very happy with how the Massachussets choclate bars came out, especially for a first try!
          </p>
          <h2>Making Chocolate Chess Pieces!</h2>
          <p>I hadn't expected such immediate success with the Massachussets chocolate bars, and was done quite early in the 
            week (Sunday). Therefore, I decided to try another technique as well. I wanted to try to see if I could use some 
            leftover 'failed' 3D printed to make <b>Chocolate Chess Pieces</b> with <b>Food Safe Silicone</b>.
            I wanted to put my failed 3D prints to use and also figured that with these pieces it didn't matter if I ruined them in the process.<br>
            I decided to the the horse and a pawn. For the horse, I had a separate top (horse) and the plateau, but I 
            figured I'd be able to attach both pieces by melting the chocolate and then holding them together to cure.<br>
            Immediately, this turned out to be a lot harder. First off, I had to fix the horse's top piece with clay because 
            the head didn't print correctly. Furthermore, I had to glue the piece to a popsticle stick with a glue gun, and figure out 
            how I was gonna make sure the pieces didn't sink to the bottom, or float to the top. I used a cross configuration 
            (see picture) and clay to add weight to the structure.<br>
            After mixing the silicone I poured it in and found out the pieces wouldn't stay straight in the cup. So I had to add
            more popsticle sticks and get create, but with a lot of glue I figured it out.
